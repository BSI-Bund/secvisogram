# Namespace - Usage

The namespace is useful to unambiguously and globally identify the vendor or manufacturer.

Often times a URL of the company or publishing party is used which is recommended.
Can also be a URL pointing to a page on which advisories are published.

In combination with the tracking ID (`/document/tracking/id`) the CSAF document is uniquely identifiable.
An additional version allows a version unique identification.
