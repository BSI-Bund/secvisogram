# Initial Release Date - Usage

The date when the first version of the document was published.
In pre-release versions the planned publication date is used.

The value should not be older than the `date` of the oldest item in Revision History (`/document/tracking/revision_history`).
Typically, this is identical to the oldest element in the revision history.
That is, `1` in case of integer versioning respectively `1.0.0` in case of semantic versioning.
The value of initial release date does not change anymore after publication of that first version.

The time should reference the point in time of the actual (planned) publication.
