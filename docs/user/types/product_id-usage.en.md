# Product ID - Usage

Used to reference the product later in the document. There is no form specification.
The value is usually assigned by the generator.
To make it easier to find errors, it is recommended to use a prefix to distinguish from group IDs.

The `product_id` should be referenced somewhere within the same documents.

The same `product_id` must not be defined more than once in the same document.
