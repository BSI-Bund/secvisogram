        "text": "A vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an affected device on TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device, which could have the following impacts:\n\nTriggering a reload of the device\nAllowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device\nCausing an indefinite loop on the affected device that triggers a watchdog crash\n\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\nSmart Install client functionality is enabled by default on switches that are running Cisco IOS Software releases that have not been updated to address Cisco bug ID CSCvd36820 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820\"].\n\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2 [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2\"]\n\nThis advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-66682\"].",

        "text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software and have the Smart Install client feature enabled.\n\nOnly Smart Install client switches are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. Cisco devices that are configured as a Smart Install director are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nFor a list of devices that support Smart Install, see Smart Install Configuration Guide - Supported Devices [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/smart_install/configuration/guide/smart_install/supported_devices.html\"].\n\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\n  Notes Regarding Specific Releases\nSmart Install client functionality is enabled by default on switches that are running Cisco IOS Software releases that have not been updated to address Cisco bug ID CSCvd36820 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820\"].\n\nSwitches that are running releases earlier than Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(52)SE are not capable of running Smart Install, but they can be Smart Install clients if they support the archive download-sw privileged EXEC command.\n  Determining Whether the Smart Install Client Feature Is Enabled\nTo determine whether a device is configured with the Smart Install client feature enabled, use the show vstack config privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install client. An output of Role: Client and Oper Mode: Enabled or Role: Client (SmartInstall enabled) from the show vstack config command confirms that the feature is enabled on the device.\n\nThe following examples show the output of the show vstack config command on Cisco Catalyst Switches that are configured as Smart Install clients:\n\n\nswitch1# show vstack config\nRole: Client (SmartInstall enabled)\n.\n.\n.\n\nswitch2# show vstack config\nCapability: Client\nOper Mode: Enabled\nRole: Client\n.\n.\n.\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\n\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\n\n\nRouter> show version\n  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\n\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\n\n\nios-xe-device# show version\n  Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

The feature allows a customer to ship a Cisco switch to any location, install it in the network, and power it on without additional configuration requirements. The Smart Install feature incorporates no authentication by design.\n\nA Smart Install network consists of exactly one Smart Install director switch or router, also known as an integrated branch director (IBD), and one or more Smart Install client switches, also known as integrated branch clients (IBCs). A client switch does not need to be directly connected to the director; the client switch can be up to seven hops away.\n\nThe director provides a single management point for images and configuration of client switches. When a client switch is first installed in the network, the director automatically detects the new switch and identifies the correct Cisco IOS Software image and the configuration file for downloading. The director can also allocate an IP address and hostname to a client.",
