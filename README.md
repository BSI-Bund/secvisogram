## About The Project

[Secvisogram](https://secvisogram.github.io) is a tool for creating and editing advisories in [CSAF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html) [format](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf_json_schema.json).

Secvisogram is inspired by the project [Vulnogram](https://vulnogram.github.io/) - "a tool for creating and editing CVE information in CVE JSON format". Both names share the same Greek suffix '-gram' which is used for denoting something written or recorded in a particular way.
Vulnerability-related information is often not enough - mostly, only the remediation information enables the end user to act efficiently in responding to these concerns. This information is usually conveyed in **Security Advisories**. Therefore, the first part of the name Secvisogram abbreviates the words _Security Advisory_.

Secvisogram aims to make it easier for vendors and other security advisory issuing parties to record the advisory details in the CSAF format.

## Getting started

Assure that you have **Node 24 (LTS) and npm 11 or newer** installed.
[Nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md) provides binary distributions for various Linux distributions.

      $ node --version ; npm --version
      v24.13.1
      11.8.0

Check out the repository and navigate to the working directory.

    git clone git@github.com:secvisogram/secvisogram.git
    cd secvisogram

Afterwards, the npm dependencies need to be installed.

    npm ci

Now you can start a development server as follows:

    npm run dev

The application is now running and accessible at http://localhost:8080. Use the `--port` argument for alternative ports, e.g. `npm run dev --port=8081`.

You can configure the application by providing a json config under the
following path `.well-known/appspecific/de.bsi.secvisogram.json`.
During development this file has to be in `app/public/.well-known/appspecific`.
This is only needed when you are using secvisogram in combination with the
[CSAF CMS Server](https://github.com/secvisogram/csaf-cms-backend). If no
config is available Secvisogram will fall back to the standalone mode which is
the same as `"loginAvailable": false`.

```json
{
  "loginAvailable": true,
  "loginUrl": "/oauth2/sign_in?rd=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080",
  "logoutUrl": "/oauth2/sign_out?rd=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080",
  "userInfoUrl": "/oauth2/userinfo",
  "validatorUrl": "http://localhost:8082"
}
```

### Deploying to Production

Please refer to [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) for a detailed description on how to build and deploy Secvisogram in production.

### Running local with validator service

1. [start csaf validator service in docker](https://github.com/secvisogram/csaf-validator-service?tab=readme-ov-file#docker)

2. Build Secvisogram docker image

   ```sh
   docker build -t csaf/secvisogram .
   ```

3. Start container
   - Start the container at port 8080. Mount the configuration as docker volume from a local directory.
     The example configuration in 'docker/appspecific' set the URL of the validator service to 'http://localhost:8082'

   - Example for Windows powershell:

     ```powershell
     docker run -it --rm  -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}/docker/appspecific:/usr/share/nginx/html/.well-known/appspecific:ro --name csaf-secvisogram csaf/secvisogram
     ```

   - Example for Unix shell:

     ```sh
     docker run -it --rm  -p 8080:80 -v "$(pwd)/docker/appspecific:/usr/share/nginx/html/.well-known/appspecific:ro" --name bsi-secvisogram bsi/secvisogram
     ```

4. Secvisogram starts on http://localhost:8080
5. In Secvisogram, the validation by the validator service can be executed with hotkey CTRL + ALT + V.

### Configure keybindings

The following hotkeys are available by default:

| shortcut         | effect                                 | comment                                   |

| f8               | Jump to next error                     | `f8` is the fixed key in the `JsonEditor` |

These can be overwritten if needed by providing an alternative keybinding in
`.well-known/appspecific/de.bsi.secvisogram.json`.
Possible keynames are defined in: [react-hotkeys](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/react-hotkeys#keyname)

```json
{
  ...,
  "keyBindings": {
    "keyNew": "ctrl+o",
    "keySave": "ctrl+s"
  }
}
```

The JSON Editor View has additional keybindings available. To get an
overview please press F1. Hint: The list is scroll and searchable.

## How to use

### Basic concepts

Similar to the Vulnogram model, the web application consists of various tabs that represent the individual views. These are represented as an HTML page which loads its data from a local browser storage using JavaScript.

To start a new document after saving, click the "New" button. Alternatively, click the "Open" button to select and load a local file.

When leaving a view without saving, e.g. reloading the application, a warning is displayed, and the user must confirm prior to leaving the page.

The `document/tracking/engine` data of new documents will be prefilled with `name` and `version` of Secvisogram.
When running with the [CSAF CMS Server](https://github.com/secvisogram/csaf-cms-backend), the backend will manage these fields along with the tracking id, and revision history.

Some fields allow the usage of markdown to format text.
Further information can be found in the [Markdown Guide](MARKDOWN-GUIDE.md)

### Form Editor

The _Form Editor_ view is an HTML form with live input validation. Additionally, the CSAF JSON Schema checks the following constraints:

- Language fields in the form are checked for plausibility against the values from the IANA database
- The consistency of CVSS string and accompanying fields is checked
- The consistency of the CWE ID and description is checked

CVSS 3 input fields are completed with the data from a possibly copied vector string and their values are recalculated. This gives the user an elegant way to use a possibly existing and copied CVSS 2.0 vector and to partially adjust the values.

A special input field is the "CWE" attribute. Here you can search the CWE catalog (XML file) by entering a value in the "id" or "name" field. For this purpose, a list with the first ten entries matching the input opens under the respective input field, from which a suitable entry can be selected and accepted.

Input errors are displayed directly alongside the respective form field. Issue counters and symbols on the top right indicate the current validation status. Clicking on this indicator reveals the sidebar with all validation issues and allows to inspect and directly jump to the respective fields.

_Opening & Saving Files_
You can open and save your CSAF JSON document at any time using the respective _Open_ and _Save_ buttons. If your document fails the validation checks, a confirmation dialog will appear.

The _CSAF Document_ tab offers functionality to extract the standard-valid subset of your current document.

When running with the [CSAF CMS Server](https://github.com/secvisogram/csaf-cms-backend), saving documents on the server and loading documents from the server is also possible for logged-in users. These users will see the corresponding `CSAF Documents` Tab on the top right.

_Identifying & Solving Validation issues_
Opening the error view in the sidebar will reveal a linked list of validation issues. Here you can click on any validation issue and directly jump to the affected form elements.

The Form Editor's interface and behavior can be configured by adjusting field [metadata](app/scripts/importUiMetaData/metaData.js).
For more detail, see the corresponding [readme](app/scripts/importUiMetaData/README.md).

### JSON Editor

The _JSON Editor_ view uses the Monaco editor to edit the JSON representation of the current CSAF document. Please note that only valid JSON content is accepted for further processing.

Hovering over a field will display validation issues. You can also click on errors in the sidebar to jump to the affected elements.
Setting the conent displayed in the sidebar is also possible by right-clicking on a field and setting the sidebar context.

Note that multiline strings are not supported in JSON value fields and will break this navigation. To add line breaks type `\n` instead.

### Preview (HTML view)

This view does not include any editing functionality. It displays a rendered HTML template view of the current CSAF document as shown in the editor views.

Use the toggle button to switch between the Rendered web view and the HTML source view. You can export this HTML document as a standalone HTML document or rendered PDF by selecting the matching option in the export dialog.

### CSAF Document (JSON view)

This view does not include any editing functionality. It **always displays the valid subset of your current CSAF document** by removing any invalid and/or empty CSAF document elements.

You can use this view and the embedded _Export CSAF_ button to always quickly extract the standard-valid subset of your current CSAF document.

### Templates

Secvisogram provides some very basic templates. You can use your own templates by saving them as JSON files on your filesystem and load using the "Upload from filesystem" in the "Create new document" dialog of the editor.
