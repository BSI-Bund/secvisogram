## Prerequisites & Development Environment

- Git
- VSCode
- Node.js (version 20 LTS)
- Firefox stable

Secvisogram recommends using Visual Studio Code as the source code IDE. A `.vscode`-profile is included in this project. It lists recommended extensions, improving the development experience.

## Secvisogram Architecture & Design

### Overview Diagram

![architecture](DEVELOPMENT-architecture.png)

### Secvisogram Components

**Entities**:
This module exports the entities of the core. Entities are classes that contain logic applied in multiple use-cases.

**Core**:
Logic that can be abstracted without UI interaction should be placed here to be tested independently. Ideally, this _facade_ exports one method for each use-case of the application.

**Page**:
The page connects the view to the core and maintains the state of the communication.

**View**:
The view is a react-component which defines the main layout of the application.

**View-Components**:
View-components are react-components which provide the actual content for the application.

## Technology Stack & Libraries

### Core Stack & Technology

**React:**
React is used to implement the views. This JavaScript library is suitable for mapping data structures to the DOM in the browser and keeping it synchronized when the structure changes. In doing so, it offers an easily customizable template language. In addition, React prevents the accidental insertion of executable code in the DOM, thus offering basic protection against cross-site scripting.

**Typescript:**
Typescript is used to type and document the source code. It is not used as the language, but rather as a static type-checker only. Types are declared using [Javascript with embedded Typescript source-code comments](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html). This keeps the overall toolchain clean and simple.

**Tailwind CSS:**
Tailwind-CSS is a CSS-Framework and library of CSS-classes to be reused across components to keep them adaptable and yet themeable.

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts the development server                                       |
| `npm test`      | Runs typecheck, the linter and the test suite                       |
| `npm run build` | Builds the application as a static asset and places it into `dist/` |

## Building & Deploying Secvisogram into Production

### Create and Building a release

To provide a production release of Secvisogram, follow the following steps:

- Run `npm run build`
- Deploy the content of the `app/dist` folder to a webserver
- Configure TLS and HTTP headers according to the template (see nginx)

### Deploy to production using nginx

Below you'll find an example configuration for hosting Secvisogram in a production environment. The example uses TLS and HTTP header pragmas like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` security hardening:

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' https: blob: ; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' unpkg.com; img-src 'self' https: data: blob: ; media-src 'none'; connect-src 'none'; ";
    add_header Referrer-Policy no-referrer;
    add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), camera=(), fullscreen=*, usb=(), payment=(), microphone=(), gyroscope=(), accelerometer=()";

## Secvisogram folder structure

| Folder             | description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `app/dist`         | The output of the build-command              |
| `app/lib`          | Source code                                  |
| `app/node_modules` | npm dependencies of the app                  |
| `app/scripts`      | Various scripts used by npm-scripts          |
| `app/seeds`        | Sample-files                                 |
| `app/tests`        | Unit-tests                                   |
| `app/vendor`       | Dependencies which aren't packaged using npm |

Source files may only access folders that have the same name as themselves and are located at the same file level, e.g.
usage of `app/lib/shared/Core/entities/DocumentEntity.js` from within `app/lib/shared/Core.js` is only allowed when importing `app/lib/shared/Core/entities.js`.

Exceptions are the so-called "shared" folders. They may be used if they are located on the same or higher file level, e.g. usage of `app/lib/shared/Core.js` from within `app/lib/SecvisogramPage.js` is allowed because it is contained in a "shared" folder.

## Technical Design

### Form Editor

The "Form Editor" tab represents the structure of the JSON schema. It uses container components to represent objects and arrays, and attribute components to represent values. Missing attributes are shown as "Add ..." buttons, which create the respective attribute using its `defaultValue`-function.

New attributes can be added by instantiating a suitable attribute component (e.g. `app/lib/SecvisogramPage/View/EditorTab/shared/TextAttribute.js`).

### Navigation

The various parts of the application are accessible using the tabs. The state indicating which tab is active is stored in the react-state in `app/lib/SecvisogramPage.js`. Navigation is only disabled if a parsing error occurs in `app/lib/SecvisogramPage/View/JsonEditorTab.js`.

### Validation

The application uses two validation patterns: The fast HTML5 validation; and the validation according to the JSON schema, which kicks in either 300ms after editing the document or when changing the tab. The status of the validation is shown in the "Form Editor" tab, the "JSON Editor" tab and the "Preview" tab.

### Sanitizing

The "CSAF Document" tab uses an algorithm to remove elements which are either invalid, empty or null (see `app/lib/shared/Core/entities/DocumentEntity.js`) and shows the removed paths.

### Data Model

The application state is maintained in the `app/lib/SecvisogramPage.js`. It contains the state which is needed to coordinate the communication with the `app/lib/shared/Core.js`. The editor state is maintained in the `app/lib/SecvisogramPage/View.js`. It contains the state of the current editing status of the document.

## Debugging & Testing Secvisogram

### Unit Tests

Unit tests account for the logic behind the `Core` component and are written using mocha.

You can run them from CLI via `npm test`. Alternatively, you can open http://localhost:8080/tests.html in your browser, which provides you with the ability to run specific tests only.

These are located in the folder `/app/tests`.

## CLI

The project includes a convenient cli for various scripts. It resides in the folder `bin/`.

Usage: `node cli.js --help`
